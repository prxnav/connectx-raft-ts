# ConnectX

It is said that all people on average are six, or fewer social connections away from each other.

This is a web application made with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/), written in [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) that finds the degrees of seperation between any two people.

The **Add People** feature allows the user to add people to the database and the **Add Relationships** feature allows the user to define relations between the added people, both ways.


On selecting the desired the two people, the application will show the degree of seperation between the same.
